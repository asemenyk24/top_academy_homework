                <p>
                Like his brother Dante, Vergil possesses the blood of Sparda in his veins. This makes him extremely powerful and due to how he had fully awakened his powers, Vergil was able to easily defeat Dante in their first confrontation. Vergil can unleash his demonic side to significantly enhance all of his powers and abilities. Nelo Angelo's energy manifest as a blue flame occasionally accompanied by blue electricity. He can coat his sword, hands, and feet in his energy to augment his attacks. By concentrating his energy into his hand, he can launch a fireball or manifest Summoned Swords. Nelo Angelo can teleport in a puff of blue flame.

                   Yep, Vergil's got himself a devil form too. He just absorbs Yamato into his skin and BAM!, full-on devil ready to kick ass.Thing is, he can still use other weapons. With that amount of power and speed, there ain't no telling just how strong he is... 
                </p>
                <p>
                He always thought that his humanity was stopping him from unleashing his full potential. Well he's sure got his demon power figured out now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this form, Yamato—the source of his power—is stored in his arms. Maybe this is the true form of Yamato too.

                <p>You shall die!</p>
                <p>Vergil can perform several Judgement Cuts both on the ground and in mid-air in rapid succession that are capable of following you into the air. He also possesses the Judgement Cut End ability —before the attack the area around Vergil gets darker, and he exclaims, “Slay All...” or “Eliminate All...”.</p>
                <p>Judgement Cut is also known as Dimension Slash. Yamato cuts through reality and slices whatever it touches when Vergil attacks.</p>
